## Featured Projects

- **Windows Intrusion Forensics (DFIR Lab)**  
  Analyzed a compromised Windows image using FTK Imager, Autopsy, and Autoruns to identify persistence mechanisms, suspicious processes, and potential exfiltration paths. Reconstructed timelines and produced remediation recommendations.

- **SOC Dashboarding & Alert Triage (Splunk)**  
  Built dashboards and analyst triage views for Windows authentication failures, privilege events, and anomalous activity to support investigation and escalation workflows.

- **Network Reconnaissance & SOC Automation (Python)**  
  Developed an Nmap-based automation wrapper that parses scan output and generates structured HTML reports. Used results to support vulnerability analysis and security reporting.

- **Threat Intelligence & Malware Analysis**  
  Conducted static and behavioral malware analysis in lab environments. Processed and enriched 30,000+ indicators, extracted IOCs, and mapped activity to known techniques.

- **Digital Forensics & Incident Response Labs (UMGC)**  
  Investigated DFIR scenarios involving IIS logs, Base64 decoding, SSH-based exfiltration, and endpoint artifacts using Autopsy, FTK Imager, Wireshark, and supporting tools.
