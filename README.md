## Featured Projects

- **Elastic SIEM + Fleet + Sysmon (Endpoint Telemetry Pipeline)**  
  Built a Fleet-managed Elastic SIEM pipeline using Sysmon v15+ to ingest process, network, and PowerShell events, validating event visibility and rule execution behavior within Kibana Discover and Elastic Security detection workflows.
- **Zeek + Filebeat → Elastic SIEM (Network Telemetry)**  
  Deployed a Zeek sensor on Ubuntu 24.04, ingested 1,500+ structured DNS and connection events via Filebeat, and validated structured telemetry ingestion and cross-source detection correlation in Elastic Security.
- **Splunk Detection Engineering & Dashboards**  
  Built SPL detections monitoring Event ID 4625 and 4672, enabling rapid host/user pivot analysis through consolidated SOC dashboards.
- **Windows Intrusion Forensics (DFIR)**  
  Investigated a simulated intrusion through IIS log analysis, Base64 artifact decoding, SSH exfiltration review, and persistence examination using Autoruns, FTK Imager, and Autopsy.
- **Network Reconnaissance & SOC Automation (Python)**  
  Developed an Nmap-based automation wrapper that parses XML output and generates analyst-ready HTML reports to streamline reconnaissance reporting and vulnerability surface identification.
