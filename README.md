## Featured Projects

- **Elastic SIEM + Fleet + Sysmon (Endpoint Telemetry Pipeline)**  
  Built a Fleet‑managed Elastic SIEM pipeline using Sysmon v15+ to ingest process, network, and PowerShell events, then validated visibility in Kibana Discover and Elastic Security.

- **Zeek + Filebeat → Elastic SIEM (Network Telemetry)**  
  Deployed a Zeek sensor on Ubuntu 24.04, ingested 1,500+ structured DNS and connection events via Filebeat, and verified real‑time telemetry and detections in Elastic.

- **Splunk Detections & Dashboards (SOC Monitoring)**  
  Created SPL searches and dashboards for failed logons and suspicious process activity, enabling triage by host, user, and event ID.

- **Windows Intrusion Forensics (DFIR Lab)**  
  Investigated a simulated intrusion using IIS logs, Base64 decoding, SSH‑based exfiltration review, and persistence analysis with Autoruns, FTK Imager, Autopsy, and supporting tools.

- **Network Reconnaissance & SOC Automation (Python)**  
  Developed an Nmap‑based automation wrapper that parses XML output and generates HTML reports to support recon and vulnerability analysis.
