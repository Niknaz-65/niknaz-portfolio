# Niknaz Sadehvandi – IT Support & Cybersecurity Projects

Welcome to my professional portfolio repository.  
I work in IT Support and Helpdesk, and I reinforce that experience with hands-on cybersecurity projects in log analysis, digital forensics labs, malware sandboxing, and network scanning.

## Featured Projects

- **Windows Intrusion Forensics (Lab Project)**  
  Analyzed a Windows image using FTK Imager, Autopsy, and Autoruns to identify persistence mechanisms, suspicious processes, and possible exfiltration paths. Documented findings and drafted a remediation plan including system rebuild and IP/domain blocking.

- **Phishing and Email Analysis (Project)**  
  Reviewed sample phishing emails, inspected headers and URLs, extracted indicators for reputation checks, and created a simple response checklist and user guidance to reduce repeat clickers in a simulated environment.

- **Network Recon and Log Analysis Toolkit (Python)**  
  Built a Python script that automates Nmap scans and generates HTML summaries of open ports and services. Combined this with basic Splunk searches to visualize authentication patterns and detect anomalous login activity.

- **Digital Forensics Labs (UMGC)**  
  Worked through multiple lab scenarios involving IIS logs, persistence artifacts, unauthorized accounts, and SSH-based data exfiltration, focusing on evidence collection and analysis steps.
